#Java Bindings for the Google Chart API.

# Introduction #

I love Google charts, and realized that every time i used them, i re-wrote a set of bindings that i could use to generate chart url's in Java. So i wrote a set of very simple Java bindings for the Google Chart API. Just check out the tests package to see how you can use the bindings.


# Details #

The source is open, you can do pretty much what ever you want with it. If you use these bindings in your project, all you have to do is to give me some credit. If you are interested in working on this project or would like to contribute some code you can send me an email.

Thanks for your interest in <b>javagchart</b>. The official set of java documentation is a work in progress. Will update that very soon.
