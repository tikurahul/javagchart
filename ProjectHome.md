I love Google charts, and find them to be an excellent alternative to plug-in based chart renderers / JavaScript based chart tool kits.

While working on multiple projects i realized that whenever i was working with Google charts, i kept rewriting bindings that would generate Google chart URL's. So in my spare time, i wrote a general set of useful Java bindings that validate chart data that the user is passing and generate the chart URL's.

These bindings support all basic chart types (line bar, and pie charts) and support various forms of data encoding.

The source is open and can be modified in which ever way you want ! (as long as you give me some credit for writing the original framework...)

There is not too much documentation yet, but there are samples in the source that will help you understand how you can use these bindings. I have kept things extremely simple.
